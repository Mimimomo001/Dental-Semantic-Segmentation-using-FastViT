# Dental Segmentation using FastViT


Performinb semantic segmentation on dental caries using the FasterViT (Faster Vision Transformer) architecture, a type of Vision Transformer (ViT) that is more rapid and precise based on various computer vision benchmarks. The suggested model produced impressive results with a Pixel Accuracy rate of 92.50% and mIoU of 79.25% (0.7925) with the customized HAT layers.
